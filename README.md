# React and Rails To Do List #

This project heavily draws upon the following two tutorials: 

Fernando Villalobos's tutorial <a href="https://www.airpair.com/reactjs/posts/reactjs-a-guide-for-rails-developers" target="_blank">React.js - A guide for Rails developers</a>.

The React <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html" target="_blank">comment tutorial</a>.

This to do list more closely follows the React practices set forward in their tutorial. Specificly, it deviates from Fernando's tutorial by: 

 * setting the url for the containing component in props
 * handling deletes through the parent component rather than individual
 * writing in jsx rather than coffee
